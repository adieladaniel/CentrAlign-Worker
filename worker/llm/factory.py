"""Build the configured LLM client.

``make_llm(settings)`` is the v1 behaviour: a process-local throttle and process-local model health. In database mode
the caller also passes the run's identity and the database (``org_id``, ``user_id``, ``run_id``, ``sessionmaker``) and
gets the shared machinery wired in:

* the API key comes from the org's vault (credential ``gemini``) when it has one, else from ``GEMINI_API_KEY``
  (``resolve_llm_key``); everything shared is keyed by the SHA-256 of that key, never by the key itself;
* a ``PgRateLimiter`` (one token bucket per key, shared by every run and process) replaces the per-run throttle;
* a ``PgModelHealth`` (which models are out of quota, per key) replaces the process-global one;
* a ``UsageRecorder`` writes a ``usage_events`` row per call and a ``QuotaGuard`` refuses calls once the org's daily
  budget is used up.
